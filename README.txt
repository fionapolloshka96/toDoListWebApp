This project contains a small To-Do list web-app designed with streamlit.

The app allows you to:
- Add items on a to-do list
- Complete (remove) items from to-do list

The main script is: webApp.py
Auxiliary module: functions.py (reads and writes in the to-do list)

To run this on your PC, use:
    streamlit run webApp.py

The app has also been deployed in this link:
